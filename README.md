# Image Hexer
A small project to play around with steganography.
Inspired by a flag at the Waikato Cybersecurity Challenge in which the key was hex encoded and put at the bottom of a logo. 

## Requirements
- PHP 7
- GD
- file uploads turned on

## TODO:
- handle file upload security better (e.g make sure the image is a PNG)
- Write a better README
